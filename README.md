# SQLProject
I have a particular interest in sustainable development. Thus, for my first SQL project I thought it would be fun to explore how renewable and nonrenewable resource accessibility &
production costs impact specific society growth measures, such as gross domestic product, of countries. 

Note this project was for my Intro to Databases class at U of T (CSC343H1). I did this project with Danielle Porto, who is assigned as a collaborator in this repository! 

All files used in this project were solely constructed by myself and Danielle Porto. 

Explanation of files...

questions.pdf: investigative questions which we aim to answer via our database. 

schema.ddl: the schema used for all queries in this project. 

demo-data.txt: contains an example interaction with the postgreSQL shell where we (1) load the schema and data, (2) run \d for each table, (3) run a SELECT count(*) query on each table 
to show the number of rows in it, and then (4) then run a SELECT * query on each table to show a sample of its content. We also used a WHERE clause to cut down to just a handful of rows. 

queries_1.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 1.

queries_2.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 2.

queries_3.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 3. 

import_views.sql: set of views created that are used in queries_2.sql and queries_3.sql. 

demo-queries.txt: contains an example interaction with the postgreSQL shell where we (1) load the schema and data successfully, then (2) run each query file and show its result.
