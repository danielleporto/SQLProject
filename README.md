# SQLProject
While completing my Computer Science Program at the University of Toronto, I have also been completing a minor in Environmental Studies.  So, when my partner and I had the opportunity to complete a project that allowed us to analyze data, we decided our project should focus on energy production and the environment.

Note this project was for my Intro to Databases class at U of T (CSC343H1) in the fall semester of 2021. This project was completed with my partner, Olivia Townsend. 

All files used in this project were solely constructed by myself and Olivia Townsend. 

**EXPLANATION OF FILES:**

questions.pdf: investigative questions which we aim to answer via our database. 

schema.ddl: the schema used for all queries in this project. 

demo-data.txt: contains an example interaction with the postgreSQL shell where we (1) load the schema and data, (2) run \d for each table, (3) run a SELECT count(*) query on each table 
to show the number of rows in it, and then (4) then run a SELECT * query on each table to show a sample of its content. We also used a WHERE clause to cut down to just a handful of rows. 

queries_1.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 1.

queries_2.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 2.

queries_3.sql: set of queries aiming to answer investigative question 3. 

import_views.sql: set of views created that are used in queries_2.sql and queries_3.sql. 

demo-queries.txt: contains an example interaction with the postgreSQL shell where we (1) load the schema and data successfully, then (2) run each query file and show its result. 

**ABOUT THE DATA:**

I have not uploaded the data yet and may choose to later on. For now, the sample of the data used can be seen in demo-data.txt.
