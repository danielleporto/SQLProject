-- Investigative question 3: What are the possible reasons for a countries' gravitation towards a particular source of 
-- energy for electricity? For instance, does a countryâ€™s availability to a resource (e.g. oil, coal, wind, sunlight) 
-- impact this? What about the costs of production? Or perhaps how developed they are? This question relies on the 
-- results of Investigate Question 2 and aims to understand them.
